Wellcome to my new blog!

I am trying this out and see how I can go with it. I am also going to import a lot of stuff from my tumblr because I haven't used it in years.

So im planing on documenting stuff im doing at home and some work stuff. I've been trying to do a lot of projects and I put effor into things but I found I keep on forgetting where I am with things and what I have to do.

This is a great way of me documenting how I do things and how I've set it up incase I forget.
